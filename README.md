## Project Overview
This project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) charging sessions using SQL to explore usage patterns, charger performance, and revenue across different cities. The goal is to practice SQL for data analysis while combining it with Excel for reporting and visualization.

Instead of using Python, all visualizations in this project were created in **Microsoft Excel**, using pivot-style summary tables and charts. This demonstrates practical skills in both SQL (for analysis) and Excel (for business-focused reporting), which are essential tools for entry-level data analyst roles.

## Key Features
- SQL analysis of EV charging session data  
- Revenue, usage pattern, and peak-hour calculations  
- Visualizations created entirely in **Microsoft Excel**  
- Pivot-style summary tables for business insights  
- Clean, professional GitHub project structure  

##  Visualizations

## Business Insights
- **DC Fast chargers generate higher revenue per session**
- **Evening hours show higher energy usage**
- **Urban stations outperform lower traffic locations**

## How to Run This Project
To explore the SQL and results yourself:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ijeomaoku/ev-nest-sql-analysis.git

2. Open the sql/ folder and run ev_nest_project.sql in your SQL environment
(PostgreSQL, MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, etc.).
3. Execute the analysis queries included in the script.


## Skills Demonstrated
- SQL (DDL, DML, Aggregations)
- Data Analysis & Business Intelligence
- Visualization using Mircosoft Excel

## Resume Bullet
- Built SQL-based data analysis project analyzing EV charging demand, pricing, and revenue using simulated operational data for a startup charging network.

## Future Enhancements
- **Add Python ETL pipeline** to automate data ingestion
- **Integrate Power BI dashboard** for interactive reporting
- **Expand dataset** to include seasonal and geographic trends
- **Predictive modeling** for demand forecasting
