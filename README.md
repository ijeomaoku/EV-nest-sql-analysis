## 🌱 Project Overview
This project analyzes EV charging sessions using SQL to explore how charging networks operate and generate revenue.
I created this project as part of my journey in building stronger data analysis skills and gaining real experience working with structured datasets.

Right now, I am practicing Excel-based data analysis. This includes cleaning data, organizing information for reporting, and creating basic summaries and visuals. I am also learning core database and SQL concepts. This project helped me apply those developing skills to a realistic business scenario and learn through hands-on practice.

I do not know everything yet, but I am confident in what I am learning and open to growing with every project.
