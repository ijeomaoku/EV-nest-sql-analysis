## Project Overview
Analyze electric vehicle (EV) charging sessions using SQL to uncover demand patterns, charger performance, and revenue drivers for a startup charging network.

## Key Features
- Realistic schema design for EV charging sessions
- Business-focused SQL queries for revenue and usage insights
- Visualizations for decision support
- Insights aligned with energy and tech domain

##  Visualizations
### Revenue by City

## Business Insights
- **DC Fast chargers generate higher revenue per session**
- **Evening hours show higher energy usage**
- **Urban stations outperform lower traffic locations**

## 🛠 How to Run This Project
To explore the SQL and results yourself:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ijeomaoku/ev-nest-sql-analysis.git

2. Open the sql/ folder and run ev_nest_project.sql in your SQL environment
(PostgreSQL, MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, etc.).
3. Execute the analysis queries included in the script.


## Skills Demonstrated
- SQL (DDL, DML, Aggregations)
- Data Analysis & Business Intelligence
- Visualization using Python & Plotly

## Resume Bullet
- Built SQL-based data analysis project analyzing EV charging demand, pricing, and revenue using simulated operational data for a startup charging network.

## Future Enhancements
- **Add Python ETL pipeline** to automate data ingestion
- **Integrate Power BI dashboard** for interactive reporting
- **Expand dataset** to include seasonal and geographic trends
- **Predictive modeling** for demand forecasting
