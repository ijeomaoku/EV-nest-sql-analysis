# EV Nest Charging Usage and Revenue Analysis

!Made with SQL
!Data Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes EV charging sessions using SQL to explore how charging networks operate and generate revenue.  
I created this project as part of my journey in building stronger data analysis skills and gaining real experience working with structured datasets.

Right now, I am practicing Excel-based data analysis. This includes cleaning data, organizing information for reporting, and creating basic summaries and visuals. I am also learning core database and SQL concepts. This project helped me apply those developing skills to a realistic business scenario and learn through hands-on practice.

I do not know everything yet, but I am confident in what I am learning and open to growing with every project.

## Business Insights
Based on the sample dataset:

- DC Fast chargers generate higher revenue per session  
- Evening hours show higher energy usage  
- Urban stations outperform lower traffic locations  

These insights help guide equipment placement, pricing, and decisions about where a charging network might expand next.

##  How to Run This Project
To explore the SQL and results yourself:

1. Open the `sql/ev_nest_project.sql` file in your SQL environment  
   (PostgreSQL, MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, and similar tools)  
2. Run the script to create the table and insert the sample charging data.  
3. Execute the analysis queries included in the script.  
4. View the charts inside the `images` folder for clear visual insights.

I kept the steps simple and beginner friendly so anyone, including other learners, can follow along.
